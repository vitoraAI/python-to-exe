# Python to EXE Builder

Python to EXE Builder is a simple Python script that allows you to convert `.py` files into standalone Windows executable files (`.exe`).

It uses **PyInstaller** to package Python code into a single executable that can run on Windows systems without requiring Python to be installed.

## Features

- Convert Python (`.py`) files to Windows executables (`.exe`)
- Choose a custom name for the output EXE file
- Build executables using PyInstaller
- Simple and straightforward workflow
- Useful for sharing, distributing, or protecting Python projects

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- Windows operating system
- Internet connection (for installing PyInstaller if not installed)

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python  
2. Select the Python file you want to convert  
3. Enter the desired EXE file name  
4. Build the executable  
5. The generated EXE file will be available in the `dist` folder

## Output

The final executable file will be created inside the `dist` directory generated by PyInstaller.
